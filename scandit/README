=======================================
 Scandit Barcode Scanner SDK for Linux
=======================================

Officially supported Linux distributions:
* Ubuntu 18.04 or newer
* Debian/GNU Linux 10 (Buster) or newer
* Raspbian 2017-08-17 or newer

Most Debian/GNU Linux based systems should be supported as as long as the
dependecy requirements below are met. RedHat based systems (RPM packages) 
are not supported officially. The tool 'alien' can be used to convert the
Debian packages to RPM packages. If you want to run the SDK on any other Linux 
distribution, unpack the .deb file and install the library and headers manually.

 Dependencies
--------------
* GCC (>= 4.9) or a comparable compiler
* libc (>= 2.27)
* pthread
* dbus (>= 1.6.8)
* zlib (>= 1.2.8: i386 and arm64 only)
* NEON CPU support (armhf only)
* OpenGLES (>= 2.0) optional for GPU acceleration
* Python (>= 3.0) optional for the Python bindings

 SDK Installation
------------------

To install the Scandit SDK you need to use the following command (please do not forget to specify the SDK version and the architecture):

`$ sudo dpkg -i libscandit-barcodescanner-X.Y.Z-architecture.deb`

The architecture you need to use depends on your system:
- amd64 for 64bit x86 systems
- i386 for 32bit x86 systems
- armhf for the Raspberry Pi 2 or 3
- armv6l for the Raspberry Pi Zero
- arm64 for 64bit ARM systems such as the Nvidia Jetson TX2

E.g. for a 64bit x86 Ubuntu desktop you have to run the following command:

`$ sudo dpkg -i libscandit-barcodescanner-5.27.1-amd64.deb`

 Sample Applications
---------------------

All sample applications are contained the samples directory and have the following dependencies:

 * Camera samples: Video4Linux2 for camera access:
 
    `$ sudo apt-get install libv4l-dev`
    
 * CommandLineBarcodeScannerImageProcessingSample: SDL2 for loading images.
 
    `$ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev`
    
 * CommandLineBarcodeScannerImageProcessingSample.py: SDL2 for python3 also for image loading.
 
    `$ sudo apt-get install python3-sdl2`
    
 * CommandLineBarcodeGeneratorSample: libpng for generating the output image.
 
    `$ sudo apt-get install libpng-dev`

Insert your license key to all sample source files.

Compile:
$ cd samples
$ make

Execute the image processing sample:
$ ./CommandLineBarcodeScannerImageProcessingSample ean13-code.png

Execute the camera sample:
$ ./CommandLineBarcodeScannerCameraSample /dev/video0 640 480

Execute the MatrixScan sample:
$ ./CommandLineMatrixScanCameraSample /dev/video1 1920 1080

Execute the barcode generator sample:
$ ./CommandLineBarcodeGeneratorSample

Execute the Python image processing sample:
$ python3 CommandLineBarcodeScannerImageProcessingSample.py ean13-code.png

 Raspberry Pi's
----------------

The SDK supports the Raspberry Pi 2, 3 and Zero. The camera has to support 
Video4Linux2 (V4L2). The following steps are required to setup V4L2:

$ sudo apt-get install v4l-utils

Put bcm2835-v4l2  into /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf
Reboot the device.

 Python
----------------

The Python bindings for the Scandit SDK are located in the zip file. To use
them, you need to ensure that they are located in a path that Python
searches for modules. One way to achieve this is to extend the `PYTHONPATH`
to also list the directory that contains `scanditsdk.py`

Note that the Python bindings are provided on a best-effort basis. They
aren't an officially supported product from Scandit.

 Gstreamer
----------------

Refer to the documentation in samples/gstreamer/README.md

 OpenCV
----------------

OpenCV barcode scanner samples are in /opencv_py_demo folder.

These examples configure the SDK for a single image use case without any
resource restrictions.

* OpenCvCppSample.cpp: OpenCV C++ API sample:

```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
```

* OpenCvPySample.py: OpenCV Python API sample:

  1. Copy ../public_api/python/scanditsdk.py locally
  2. Update LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable with a path to libscanditsdk.so library, e.g.

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/$USER/scanditsdk/lib
```
